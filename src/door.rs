//! The only way in.
//!
//! ## What this program answers, and to whom
//!
//! Two surfaces on one listener, and they are not the same audience:
//!
//! | path | who | guarded by |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `GET /` · `POST /pair` · `POST /unpair` | the person at this machine | **loopback only** |
//! | `POST /ask` · `GET /have` | the paired Host | **the bearer** |
//!
//! The split matters. The person's surface accepts no bearer and is refused off-loopback, so a
//! machine on the network cannot reach the page that disconnects this one. The Host's surface
//! accepts no substitute for the secret, so **loopback is not authentication and neither is a
//! LAN** — the same sentence Epoch's own door states, and the reason this program exists rather
//! than `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0`.
//!
//! ## The bearer is compared in constant time
//!
//! A comparison that stops at the first wrong byte tells whoever is guessing how much of the
//! secret was right, one request at a time.
