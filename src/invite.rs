//! The code this machine shows, when the Host has to be the one to reach out.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! The ordinary way round is [`crate::door::redeem`]: this machine dials the Host, so nobody
//! types an IP. It needs this machine to be able to *open a connection to* the Host, and on a
//! real network that turned out not to be true — with this machine on Wi-Fi and the Host on
//! Ethernet, every connection it started was dropped (445, 135, 3389 and 11501 alike, with the
//! Host's firewall rule present and a listener confirmed up), while every connection the Host
//! started here succeeded. That is client isolation, and it belongs to a router somebody may
//! not own.
//!
//! So the same exchange runs backwards: **this machine shows the code and the Host reaches out**.
//!
//! ## The code is what makes that safe
//!
//! In this direction the listener is exposed to the network by design — anything on it can send
//! an `Enrol`. The code is the whole of the defence, so it is checked here, it lasts five minutes,
//! and it is spent the moment it works.
