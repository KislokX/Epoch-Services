//! The one page this program has.
//!
//! ## Why a served page and not a window
//!
//! This program already needs an HTTP listener — that is its whole job. Adding a webview
//! framework on top of a server that exists would be the heaviest way to draw four fields, and
//! it would also be the only reason this could not run on a headless Linux box that somebody
//! reaches over SSH.
//!
//! So the interface is one page, served on loopback, in Epoch's own visual language: the same
//! dark ground, the same gold, the same monospace. Everything is inline — no font from a CDN,
//! no script from anywhere. A program whose job is to be a careful door does not fetch its own
//! appearance from the internet.
//!
//! ## What it says when nothing has happened
//!
//! Unpaired is not an error and does not look like one. It is what every machine is before
//! somebody pairs it, and the page's whole content in that state is the one thing to do next.

/// ## Why it is not in Settings
///
/// It was, and it was the largest thing on a page otherwise about the Hugging Face CLI and a
/// directory. *Start the thing that runs models* is not a setting — it is the second thing
/// somebody does on a machine they are lending, right after connecting it, and burying it under
/// a tab named for configuration made it something to find rather than something to press.
///
/// ## Three facts, three fixes
///
/// **Installed** · **serving** · **neither**. Install it, start it, or nothing at all. They stay
/// apart because they have different answers, and telling somebody to install what they already
/// have is exactly the failure keeping them apart prevents.
///
/// Starting is **offered, never done** on this machine's behalf: the command opens in the
/// machine's own terminal, where its output and any prompt belong to the person reading them.
/// Nothing here claims success either — a terminal opened is all it can honestly say.
/// What a runtime says it will run a model **on**, in its own words, and what that costs.
///
/// Only llama.cpp answers this (`--list-devices`), and the answer turned out to matter more than
/// anything else on the deck: the same GGUF took 36.7 s through a Vulkan build and 11.3 s
/// through a CUDA one, on the same card. Somebody who installed llama.cpp from the button above
/// is getting a third of their card with nothing on screen to say so.
///
/// `handicap` is `None` for a vendor Epoch cannot name a native path for, and silence is the
/// honest answer there — a menu of backends would eventually recommend hardware that cannot run
/// one. Empty `devices` means the question was never answerable, not that there is no card.
