//! EpochServices — one window, and the door behind it (ADR-0029 §9).
//!
//! ## What this program is for
//!
//! A machine with a graphics card and no Epoch on it. It lends the models it has to an Epoch
//! Host on the same network, over a connection that was **paired** rather than merely typed.
//!
//! The alternative it replaces is `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0`, which makes a machine useful to a Host
//! and to everything else on that network at the same time. **Here Ollama stays on
//! `127.0.0.1`** and this program is the only listener — the one that knows what a secret is.
//!
//! ## Why it may not link the Engine
//!
//! It depends on `epoch-kernel` and nothing else of Epoch's, and `Cargo.toml` is where that is
//! enforced. Linking `epoch-engine` would put Quests, Chronicles, Knowledge and Trust inside a
//! program that must own none of them; the boundary would become a rule somebody has to
//! remember rather than one the build holds.
//!
//! ## One window, and it is a view of the server
//!
//! The server is the product; the window is a frame around a page the server already had to be
//! able to draw. So there is no bundler, no `ui/` folder and no frontend build — the HTML is a
//! Rust string, and the same page answers a browser on a headless box.
//!
//! ## Two doors, because there are two audiences
//!
//! | door | who | where it is bound | what guards it |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | [`door::WINDOW_PORT`] | the person at this machine | `127.0.0.1` **only** | it is not on the network |
//! | [`door::PORT`] | the paired Host | every interface, **TLS** | the bearer, and the certificate |
//!
//! They were one listener until the audit, told apart by `if mine` on forty match arms. The
//! property everybody wanted — *the pages are not reachable from the network* — was therefore
//! true by repetition rather than by construction, and it needed the whole file to stay true.
//!
//! And the Host's half is encrypted now. What crosses it is the composed turn: the user's
//! Chronicle, their system prompt, their project's context — and, at pairing, the secret itself.
//! Anything on that network could read all of it. See `epoch_wire::tls` for what a certificate
//! means on a network with no authority to ask.
