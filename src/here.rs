//! ## Measured on the machine that is offering it
//!
//! The Host never estimates what a remote can do. It asks, and this answers — which is the same
//! rule every probe in Epoch follows, applied across a network. A number this file cannot get is
//! reported as **unknown**, never as zero: a machine with no NVIDIA card has no VRAM reading,
//! and *nobody could tell you* is a different answer from *nothing fits*.
//!
//! ## Every runtime stays on localhost
//!
//! This talks to loopback and nothing else does. That is the whole security win of having a
//! companion program at all (ADR-0029 §9): without it, lending a machine means
//! `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0`, and then anything on that network can use the card.
//!
//! **There are three of them now**, and the rule did not change with the count — it got a
//! second half. A turn may say *which* program should run it, by an id from a closed set this
//! file already knows; it may never say *where*. Resolution happens here, on the machine that
//! owns the ports, so the worst a malformed request can do is name something that does not
//! exist and be told so.
