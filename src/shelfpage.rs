//! The Models Workshop, as a page.
//!
//! ## No script, and the tabs are links
//!
//! This program's CSP is `script-src: 'none'`, and that is not an obstacle to work around — it is
//! the reason a careful door can be trusted. So the tabs are two URLs, every action is a form,
//! and the one thing that genuinely needs to change over time — a download in progress — uses
//! `<meta http-equiv="refresh">`, which is HTML older than the problem.
//!
//! ## What it refuses to hide
//!
//! A model larger than this machine's memory can still be pulled. The button says **PULL ANYWAY**
//! and the sentence beside it says what will happen, because Epoch does not decide for somebody
//! who already decided. What it will not do is let that happen *silently*, which is exactly what
//! happened before this existed: 17.7 GB arrived on a 17.2 GB machine and nothing said a word.
