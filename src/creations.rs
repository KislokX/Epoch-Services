//! The Creations Workshop, on a machine that is lending its card.
//!
//! ## Why this is here at all
//!
//! **A lent machine is the machine an asset would be installed onto** (ADR-0029 §9, and the
//! standing two-surfaces rule). A picture drawn on this computer loads *this* computer's
//! checkpoints and LoRAs; installing them on the Host would put a 6 GB file where nothing that
//! draws can reach it. So the shelf that fetches them belongs on both surfaces, or on the wrong
//! one.
//!
//! ## The same Engine, and none of the Engine
//!
//! Every question is asked through `epoch-models`: one `Catalogue`, one `Asset`, one library,
//! one install path — exactly as on the Host. What differs is the frame: no Kernel, no Quests,
//! no Trust, because this program owns none of those (ADR-0029 §9). The only thing written twice
//! is HTML.
//!
//! ## The same credential store
//!
//! A key lives in this operating system's own store — DPAPI, the Keychain, the Secret Service —
//! through the same `epoch-secrets` crate the Host uses. A machine lending its card is as likely
//! to be a Mac as a PC, which is the whole reason that crate exists rather than a second copy of
//! one. Settings is where a key is pasted; nothing here ever shows one back.
