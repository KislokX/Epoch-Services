//! Mapping a model's curve **on this machine's card**.
//!
//! ## Why this exists, and why it did not until now
//!
//! A curve is kept as [`Best`], keyed by *model + card + build* — so it is a fact about one
//! graphics card and one llama.cpp, by construction. `deck::about` reads the `loadouts.json`
//! that lives beside **this** machine's library, with **this** machine's card.
//!
//! On a lent machine that file was empty and **nothing could ever fill it.** This page refused
//! to start a search, the Host's Workshop measures the Host, and the page said so in a sentence
//! that was simply untrue:
//!
//! > *Epoch's own Workshop can map the curve.*
//!
//! It cannot. It maps the Host's card. A MacBook lent to a desktop was being shown a control
//! whose only advice pointed at a measurement of somebody else's hardware — which is worse than
//! a blank reading, because it sends the reader somewhere confidently wrong.
//!
//! The owner put it plainly: *it is a different PC with everything different; we are not going
//! to use a configuration made on a 4070 SUPER for a MacBook.* Exactly so.
//!
//! ## What had to move: nothing
//!
//! Worth writing down, because the cost was assumed to be a crate boundary and measured to be
//! zero. The search itself is [`loadout::explore`] and both real probes — `Bench` for
//! llama.cpp, `Served` for Ollama — are already in `epoch-models`, which this program links.
//! ADR-0029 keeps `epoch-engine` out of here and never came into it.
//!
//! So the search was runnable from this program the whole time and had simply never been
//! wired to a route. **The boundary was believed rather than checked**, and one grep at the
//! right altitude replaced several minutes of planning to move eight hundred lines.
//!
//! ## It stays the Host's decision to ask
//!
//! Mapping a curve costs minutes of the card somebody lent you, so this never happens on a read
//! path and never on a page load: it is a button on this machine, pressed by whoever owns it.
//! The Host cannot start one over the bridge, which keeps `/have` and `/draw` the only two
//! routes a turn reaches.
