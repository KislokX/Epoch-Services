//! What is actually on this machine, and the one destructive button either surface has.
//!
//! ## The two-surfaces rule, applied on purpose rather than after the fact
//!
//! Epoch's MODELS deck answers *what is on this computer* — and on a lent machine, **this** is
//! the computer holding the weights. A Host's inventory is an inventory of the Host; the person
//! standing at the machine that actually has thirty gigabytes of models on it needs to see them
//! and be able to take one off.
//!
//! What counts as a model, how it is timed, and what removing one means all live in
//! `epoch_models` and are shared verbatim. Two copies of *what counts as a model this machine
//! has* is exactly how the two surfaces come to disagree.
//!
//! ## What this surface deliberately does not do
//!
//! It does not **search** for a loadout. That costs four minutes of a graphics card, and this is
//! somebody else's computer — the machine agreed to answer turns, not to be benchmarked by a
//! web page. `TIME IT` is here because it is one short answer and it is asked for; the search is
//! the Host's to offer, on the Host's own hardware.
//!
//! It does **choose** from a curve that has already been measured, because that costs nothing
//! and it is the machine's own recipe. Refusing to show it here meant the person standing at the
//! computer holding the weights could delete a model but not say how it loads — and the rule
//! that made the search the Host's job says nothing about a decision that is free.
